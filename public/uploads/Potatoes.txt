One time, Lachlan the potato decided to [verb] a [noun]. He invited all of his [plural_noun] and [plural_noun]. It was going to be so much fun! At 2 am Carl, Cheryl, and Johnathan arrived. Soon, even more cars arrived. The potato yelled "OHEMGEE", once many potatoes had arrived. It was amazing. Then, it went downhill quickly. Cortana had [past_verb] and he was no longer going to [verb] any [plural_noun]. Then at 3 am, Lachlan went to bed, disappointed of his actions becuase he had [past_verb]. He dreamt of [plural_noun] that night.
